Forked from Xah Lee's excelled xah-fly-keys https://github.com/xahlee/xah-fly-keys

A modal keybinding for emacs (like vi), but based on command frequency and ergonomics.

This is the most efficient editing system in the universe. (more so than vim.)

Xah Lee's version is for DVORAK keyboard, whereas mine is for QWERTY keyboard.
